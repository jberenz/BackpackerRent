### `index()`

**Route:** `/`

**Methods:** `GET`

**Purpose:** Render the home page and display available offers based on optional filters: region, category, price range, type (e.g., backpacker, radtour), and rental period. Filters out offers that are already rented in the specified period. The function dynamically limits categories depending on the selected type (e.g., "backpacker" or "radtour").
